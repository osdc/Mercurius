Welcome to Mercurius, the official Newsletter of OSDC!!<br>

Greetings and a warm welcome to the debut edition of our extraordinary newsletter initiative, a labor of love that has been in the works for quite some time now! 🚀 What better way to kick things off than by recapping the fantastic events we've covered throughout the year? These adventures reflect the rich history of our participation in programs like Google Summer of Code (GSOC), ASOC, SIH, and our role in organizing exciting events such as CodeJam, OSDHACK, and other initiatives. Plus, we've sprinkled in some fun and insightful meetups and workshops that we regularly host. Here's to celebrating our journey together!


# Events

### OSDHack

Let's take a stroll down memory lane to revisit OSDHack, the incredible online hackathon orchestrated by the Open Source Developers Community of JIIT, Noida. Picture this: a 48-hour marathon of pure hacking bliss, where passionate tech enthusiasts and like-minded hackers came together to brainstorm, collaborate, and bring their ideas to life.

Oh, and here's the fun twist – OSDHack wasn't just your ordinary hackathon; it was a hybrid extravaganza that transcended physical boundaries! With nearly a thousand participants joining forces, this event became a melting pot of creativity, innovation, and sheer fun. From coding marathons to brilliant tech discussions, OSDHack was the place to be for anyone craving an unforgettable hacking adventure! 


### CTF

OSDC took us on an exciting journey to unravel the secrets of cybersecurity and navigate the thrilling maze of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We delved into the realm of digital security, discovering the art of honing our skills through the magic of CTFs. Back in the day, when it came to cybersecurity, many of us were beginners, feeling a bit awestruck by the complexities of technology. But fear not, because we turned that intimidation into an adventure, learning and laughing our way through the fantastic world of cybersecurity! 

### Code Jam

Have you ever found yourself intrigued by the Code Jam experience? Allow us to take you on a quick trip down memory lane. In our previous editions, the community came together, forming dynamic teams that collaborated to create remarkable projects within the span of just a week, each project centered around a given theme. The energy was electric, the collaboration inspiring. Now, gear up for more excitement! Our next online edition is scheduled for this December-end. Keep your eyes peeled for updates as we gear up for another round of coding adventures! Get ready for the thrill of Code Jam! 

# Meetups

### Introduction to OSS

Ever wondered how you could dive into the dynamic world of open source, unleash your skills, and shape the future of software? Well, we delved into the incredible realm of open-source software (OSS) in a past meetup. Picture this: a session filled with insights, a guided career talk, and a lively Q&A at the end.

Our goal? To empower you to leave your mark on the software landscape. It wasn't just a meetup; it was a journey into the heart of OSS, where learning and fun converged. Stay tuned for more exciting meetups in the future, as we continue exploring the endless possibilities of open source! 

  

### Git/Github Workshop

We unraveled the mysteries of wild branches, cast spells with commits, and learned the art of merging with the wisdom of a thousand wizards. GitHub, the land of collaboration, stood as our trusty sidekick throughout this magical journey.
It wasn't just a workshop; it was a fun-filled exploration where version control became a tale of collaboration and branches danced to the rhythm of coding magic.


### LINUX Meetup

Ever wondered why we OSDCians are all die-hard Linux fans? Well, for starters its the freedom of customization and all security features that all the cool distros around the internet comes packed with but what hooked us was the efficient development workflow that is achieved when you switch to Linux!! It was an energy packed meetup where we explored stuffs like these and many more things.
  

### Google Summer of Code (GSOC)

In this meetup, we delved into the exciting worlds of GSoC, LFX and other open source programs. Imagine an engaging session where students were guided by alumnis and seniors with hands-on experience in these programs. It wasn't just about information; it was a pathway paved with insights and mentorship, connecting aspiring minds with seasoned professionals.

### Text Editors & IDE Meetup

 In a blast-from-the-past meetup, our core team members dived into the world of text editors and IDEs. Picture this: Students fearlessly conquering the wild territories of Vim, finally mastering the elusive 'exit' command and tweaking its magical settings. But that's not all! We ventured into the realms of Emacs, Nano, and even danced on the edge with VS Code (or, as we fondly call it, 'electron sh**').

## How You Can Get Involved ?

OSDC is an open community where we learn and laugh together, we try to explore the world with the lens of a real developer with a focus on new and emerging technologies round the globe. With a great alumni support to guide us, we thrive to flourish into a developer in "actual sense". If you're inspired to be a part of this growing community, joining our discord server would be the first step, just drop a "Hi!!" in [#general](https://discord.gg/yH5GxE23cZ) and get ready to meet some awesome people to help you in your journey as a developer. Also, be wary of the realms of #watercooler-banter, you might step into Tracy and technochan there☠️☠️.

We have a numerous in-house projects to start your open-source contribution journey, which you find on our [github](github.com/osdc).
Happy contributing!!
